# Jobhopper

## General Information

Jobhopper is an application for analyzing and querying career mobility and outside options data set to help workers, public sector professionals, and policymakers to improve career training, career paths, and career mobility options.


## Scope and Problem Statement

Many workers have limited outside options for career and wage progression outside their current occupations. The quality of outside options matter for workersâ€™ wages but limited data exists to provide guidance and training to workers on occupational mobility and outside-options (Monopsony and Outside Options. Schubert, Stansbury,and Taska. Harvard University, March 2020). The problem that we are tryingto solve is to provide better insight than standard data sets for improving occupational mobility options, improving worker wages, and improving policies related to investments and training.

Questions that JobHopper will be trying to answer:

- How might we enable citizens to have better information about the career paths that they could move into from their current job? How can citizens weigh and negotiate options for a new career path?
- How might we equip policymakers with labor market data
- How might we identify where the labor market is headed and what skills and abilities are needed in the new jobs
- How might we equip workforce development systems with job transfer data to understand regional trends in employee movements
