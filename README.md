# Jobhopper Project

## How might we equip policymakers, workforce development systems, and labor market analysts with easy-to-use labor market data, to help them understand:
1. occupational trends in their national, regional, or local labor market
2. what skills and abilities their area has, and what it might need in the future
3. how their local labor market might respond to positive or negative shocks
